Hello. My name is Shani Sharif. I am an architect and researcher, currently pursuing my doctoral studies in Computational Design at the [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu) Department of Architecture. I hold a SMArchS degree in Design and Computation from [MIT](http://web.mit.edu), a Master of Architecture from Shahid Beheshti University, and a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Tehran. With a major in digital fabrication and a minor in computer science and cognitive science, my research concerns the interrelation between robotic fabrication, material properties and design knowledge in the process of design. Currently, I teach robotic and digital fabrication courses at [Digital Fabrication Laboratory](http://www.dbl.gatech.edu/dfl/home), and research in BIM focused projects at [Digital Building Lab](http://www.dbl.gatech.edu) at Georgia Tech. I was previously an adjunct professor at Wentworth Institute of Technology where I taught courses on complex geometries and fabrication, a researcher at MIT Media Lab and School of Architecture and Planning, and project architect at Design Core and ATEC Consultants.
