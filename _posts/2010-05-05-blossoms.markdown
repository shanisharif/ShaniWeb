**Interactive Blossoms receives  MIT Council for the Arts Grant:**

Interactive Blossoms is an interdisciplinary project that integrates ideas derived from interactive behaviors in natural organisms with the art of paper folding, especially deployable origami. The flower-like deployable origami models imitate blooming of plants in nature. In this project, the origami models are equipped with electronic parts to present responsive behaviors to the movement and touch of users in the environment.
